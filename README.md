🚀 Title : Mini Data Science Project: Data Cleansing, Merging & Aggregation in Python (Pandas)

Data is the new oil — but only when it’s clean, structured, and ready for analysis! 🧹

Recently, I worked on a mini Data Science project focused on Data Cleansing and Aggregation using Python (Pandas). This project helped me strengthen my data wrangling and preprocessing skills — an essential step before any meaningful analysis or visualization can be done.

Here’s a quick breakdown of what I did 👇

🔹 Step 1: Imported essential libraries like pandas and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

🔹 Step 2: Created two small sample datasets —

One containing employee information (with some missing values).

Another containing employee project details (for merging).

🔹 Step 3: Identified and handled missing data by:

Filling missing names with “Unknown”

Replacing missing departments using the mode (most frequent value)

Filling missing salary values with the mean salary

🔹 Step 4: Performed string operations to clean up the data — capitalized names and standardized department names to uppercase.

🔹 Step 5: Explored different types of joins (merge operations) —

Inner Join: Employees who have assigned projects

Left Join: All employees, even those without projects

Outer Join: Every record from both datasets

🔹 Step 6: Used the GroupBy function to calculate the average salary per department, which revealed interesting patterns in pay distribution across departments.

🔹 Step 7: Visualized the insights using a simple bar chart in Matplotlib to make data-driven observations more intuitive.

Through this project, I learned how data cleaning and transformation form the foundation of every data science workflow. Even simple datasets can teach a lot about handling real-world data inconsistencies.

🧠 Key takeaway: Clean data → Better insights → Smarter decisions!
